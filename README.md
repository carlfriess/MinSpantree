# Kruskal's Algorithm - Java vs. Go vs. JavaScript vs. Swift vs. Lisp

As part of my studies I implemented Kruskal's Algorithm in Java. To see how it would compare, I decided to implement the Algorithm in Go, JavaScript, Swift and plain C as well. On my system the Go implementation turned out to be the fastest. A classmate implemented the Algorithm also in Common Lisp

The program accepts data in the `stdin` and returns its result to `stdout`. An example for input data is shown in `test.in` with the corresponding correct output in `test.out`.

The first integer is the number of problems. Each problem consists first of two integers 1 â‰¤ `n`,`m` indicating the number of vertices and edges respectively. Then follow `m` pairs of three integers representing an edge. The first two integers denote the vertices on each end of the edge, while the third integer denotes the edge's weight.

## Execution time

These are the execution times on my system for the test data included in `test.in`.

### C:
```
real    0m0.043s
user    0m0.037s
sys     0m0.004s
```

### Go:
```
real    0m0.047s
user    0m0.039s
sys     0m0.006s
```

### JavaScript (Node.js):
```
real    0m0.192s
user    0m0.170s
sys     0m0.023s
```

### Objective-C:
```
real    0m0.240s
user    0m0.227s
sys     0m0.007s
```

### Swift:
```
real    0m0.533s
user    0m0.524s
sys     0m0.007s
```

### Java:
```
real    0m0.279s
user    0m0.622s
sys     0m0.062s
```

### PHP:
```
real    0m6.593s
user    0m6.534s
sys     0m0.030s
```

### Lisp (Common Lisp):
```
real    0m0.156s
user    0m0.135s
sys     0m0.016s
```

###Haskell:
```
real    0m1.721s
user    0m1.689s
sys     0m0.021s
```
