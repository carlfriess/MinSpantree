#Kruskal's Algorithm - Java vs. Go

As part of my studies I implemented Kruskal's Algorithm in Java. To see how it would compare, I decided to implement the Algorithm in Go as well. On my system the Go implementation turned out to be about 17x faster.

The program accepts data in the `stdin` and returns its result to `stdout`. An example for input data is shown in `test.in` with the corresponding correct output in `test.out`.

The first integer is the number of problems. Each problem consists first of two integers 1 â‰¤ `n`,`m` indicating the number of vertices and edges respectively. Then follow `m` pairs of three integers representing an edge. The first two integers denote the vertices on each end of the edge, while the third integer denotes the edge's weight.
